My Library is a project that allows a user to manage a home library.  The user can:
1. Add books to their library via a link on the home page
2. Access a list of all books in their library ordered alphabetically by author last name
3. Delete books from their library
4. Edit the books in their library
The home page lists the top three books based on highest ratings and lists the most recent book by index value.
